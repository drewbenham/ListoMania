# ListoMania
Android physical media application

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

ListoMania is a simple application used to catalog physical media. The types of media it will eventually support will be Records, CD's, Cassettes, DVD's, Bluray, and VHS. Currently it only does Records. I would also like to eventually add the support for custom lists.

It will use IMDB and Musicbrainz API's to search and add new media to their respective lists. In the future I would like to add the capability to scan UPC codes to add information directly to the lists as well.
